Purpose: Create tidy data sets from the UCI HAR Dataset
This Repo contains the following files:

CodeBook.md - A description of variables in the txt file
run_analysis.R - The R script required to create the tidy data sets
README.md - how all of the scripts work and how they are connected

First, understand the files in the original data

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
